Changes for 1.3.2
=================
With Bj√∂rn Kautler's help, we've made the following changes for 1.3.2.
- Errors and omissions from the README have been corrected.

- The names of the properties where the plugin will get the environment name
  and the user name are now configurable (Issue #9).

- The maven central credentials are now only required if I'm actually uploading
  to maven central, so other users can now build the plugin. (Issue #10).

Changes for 1.3.1
=================
- Filter tokens used to contain property names in dot notation (some.var.name),
  they are now also added in original camel case (someVarName) to resolve
  issue #5

Changes for 1.3.0
=================
- Added support for setting a property via environment variables or system 
  properties, as specified in the Gradle user guide, section 14.2. (Issue #4)
